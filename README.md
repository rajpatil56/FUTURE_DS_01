* [cite_start]**Furniture Margin Correction:** Investigate why Furniture contributes high revenue ($742K) but extremely low profit (6.44%) to identify potential shipping or discount issues[cite: 76, 96].
* [cite_start]**Logistics Optimization:** Since Standard Class is the most used shipping mode (59%), negotiating better rates for this tier will have the largest impact on the bottom line[cite: 9, 61].
* [cite_start]**Consumer Retention:** Focus marketing campaigns on the "Consumer" segment, as they represent over half of the company's total revenue[cite: 7, 72].
